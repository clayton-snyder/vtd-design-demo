# vtd-design-demo
Code is all in main.lua

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
A very rudimentary demo I made for my friend’s capstone project for visual design. He designed the map and all the assets and animations as part of his project, and wanted a simple demonstration which showed the animation and the general idea of his design. 

Demonstrates basic animation scripting principles using sprite sheets with rotating “quads”. I was only provided sheets for left and right run cycles as well as idling, so running up or down is pretty awkward. There are no collisions because I didn’t get trees, rocks, etc. as separate assets; just as one whole image.

Arrow keys to move

E to interact (with bug swarms or with your ship)

Things you can do:
  * Walk around 
  * Spray the bug swarms
  * Run out of oxygen and die (bar on the bottom of the screen represents remaining oxygen)
  * Return to your ship to replenish oxygen and remove all the bugs you’ve sprayed from the map
